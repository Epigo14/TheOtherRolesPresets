# Why?
The mod introduced a lot of new and fun gameplays. However, randomness, role-based full clears and instant busts often replace investigations.
Among Us was desidgned as a social deduction game and while playing TheOtherRoles, meetings often deal with role reveals instead of finding the imposters.
Here are some presets which intend to match nerfed roles and to support tracing and deception.
